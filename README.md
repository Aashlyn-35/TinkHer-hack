Project Description

The Lost & Found Web Application helps users report lost and found items efficiently. It connects individuals who have lost items with those who have found them, providing an easy-to-use interface for searching, reporting, and retrieving lost belongings.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People lose their things every day, but instead of finding them, they buy new ones! What a waste!

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

A smart, simple, and elegant Lost & Found system that reunites people with their lost items faster than ever before! üöÄ
